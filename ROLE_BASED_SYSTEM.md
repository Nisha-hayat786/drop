# Role-Based System Implementation

This project now includes a role-based authentication system that automatically routes users to different dashboards based on their role.

## 🎯 How It Works

### Login Process
1. User enters email and password on the login page
2. System checks the email to determine user role:
   - **SuperAdmin**: Any email containing "admin" or "super"
   - **Venue**: All other emails (default role)
3. User is automatically redirected to the appropriate dashboard

### Role-Based Routing

#### SuperAdmin Dashboard (`/superadmin`)
- **Access**: Users with emails containing "admin" or "super"
- **Features**: 
  - Overview statistics (Total Users, New Users, Active Users, Banned Users)
  - Traffic analytics with line charts
  - Location analytics with donut charts
  - Quick actions for managing users, venues, and posts
- **Design**: Dark sidebar with DROP branding, professional admin interface

#### Venue Dashboard (`/`)
- **Access**: All other users (default role)
- **Features**: 
  - Watch statistics and revenue charts
  - Clicks statistics with pie charts
  - Popular posts display
  - Post management and subscriptions
- **Design**: Original venue dashboard design

## 🔐 Demo Credentials

### SuperAdmin Access
- **Email**: `admin@drop.com` (or any email with "admin")
- **Password**: Any password
- **Redirects to**: `/superadmin`

### Venue Access
- **Email**: `venue@drop.com` (or any email without "admin")
- **Password**: Any password
- **Redirects to**: `/` (venue dashboard)

## 🛠 Technical Implementation

### Components Created
- `SuperAdmin.jsx` - SuperAdmin dashboard with analytics
- `SuperAdminSidebar.jsx` - Navigation for SuperAdmin
- `SuperAdminLayout.jsx` - Layout wrapper for SuperAdmin
- `RoleRedirect.jsx` - Handles role-based routing logic

### Updated Components
- `Login.jsx` - Now handles role detection and routing
- `Header.jsx` - Added logout functionality and role display
- `App.jsx` - Added SuperAdmin routes

### Key Features
- ✅ **Automatic Role Detection**: Based on email content
- ✅ **Role-Based Routing**: Different dashboards for different roles
- ✅ **Session Management**: Uses localStorage for role persistence
- ✅ **Logout Functionality**: Clears session and redirects to login
- ✅ **Role Display**: Shows current user role in header
- ✅ **Responsive Design**: Works on all screen sizes

## 🚀 Usage

1. **Start the application**
2. **Navigate to login page**: `/auth/login`
3. **Enter credentials**:
   - For SuperAdmin: Use `admin@drop.com` with any password
   - For Venue: Use `venue@drop.com` with any password
4. **Automatic redirect** to appropriate dashboard
5. **Logout** using the logout button in the header

## 🔄 Role Switching

To test different roles:
1. Logout using the logout button
2. Login with different email:
   - `superadmin@drop.com` → SuperAdmin dashboard
   - `venue@drop.com` → Venue dashboard
   - `manager@drop.com` → Venue dashboard (default)

## 📱 Responsive Design

Both dashboards are fully responsive:
- **Desktop**: Full layout with sidebar navigation
- **Tablet**: Adjusted spacing and layout
- **Mobile**: Stacked layout for better mobile experience

## 🎨 Design Consistency

- **SuperAdmin**: Professional admin interface with dark sidebar
- **Venue**: Original design maintained for venue users
- **Shared Elements**: Consistent header, logout, and navigation patterns

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- Real API integration for authentication
- More granular role permissions
- Role-based feature access
- Advanced user management
- Audit logs for admin actions
